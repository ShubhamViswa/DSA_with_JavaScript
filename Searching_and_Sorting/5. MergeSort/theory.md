### Merge Sort: An Overview

**Merge Sort** is a classic **divide-and-conquer algorithm** that is widely used for sorting. It recursively divides the array into halves until the base case (a single element or an empty array) is reached, then merges these sorted subarrays to produce a sorted array.

---

### How Merge Sort Works

1. **Divide**: Split the array into two halves.
2. **Conquer**:
   - Recursively sort the left half.
   - Recursively sort the right half.
3. **Combine**: Merge the two sorted halves into one sorted array.

---

### Steps in Detail

#### 1. Splitting the Array
- Divide the array into two halves until each subarray contains a single element.
- This is the **divide** phase and occurs in \( O(\log n) \) time since the array is repeatedly halved.

#### 2. Merging the Arrays
- Combine two sorted arrays into a single sorted array.
- This is the **conquer** phase and takes \( O(n) \) time for each level.

### Algorithm

Here’s the pseudocode for Merge Sort:

```text
MergeSort(array, left, right):
    if left < right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        MergeSort(array, left, mid)      // Sort the left half
        MergeSort(array, mid + 1, right) // Sort the right half
        Merge(array, left, mid, right)   // Merge the sorted halves
```

The `Merge` function combines two sorted subarrays into a single sorted array:
- **Left subarray**: \( array[left..mid] \)
- **Right subarray**: \( array[mid+1..right] \)

```text
Merge(array, left, mid, right):
    n1 = mid - left + 1
    n2 = right - mid
    Create temporary arrays L[0..n1-1] and R[0..n2-1]
    
    Copy data into temporary arrays:
        L[0..n1-1] = array[left..mid]
        R[0..n2-1] = array[mid+1..right]

    Merge the temporary arrays back into the original array:
        i = 0, j = 0, k = left
        while i < n1 and j < n2:
            if L[i] <= R[j]:
                array[k] = L[i]
                i += 1
            else:
                array[k] = R[j]
                j += 1
            k += 1

    Copy any remaining elements of L[]:
        while i < n1:
            array[k] = L[i]
            i += 1
            k += 1

    Copy any remaining elements of R[]:
        while j < n2:
            array[k] = R[j]
            j += 1
            k += 1
```

### Time Complexity
- **Best case**: \( O(n \log n) \)
- **Average case**: \( O(n \log n) \)
- **Worst case**: \( O(n \log n) \)

### Space Complexity
- \( O(n) \), due to temporary arrays used during merging.

---

### Properties
- **Stable**: Maintains the relative order of equal elements.
- **Not In-Place**: Requires additional memory for merging.

### Visualization
Let's walk through an example: **Array = [38, 27, 43, 3, 9, 82, 10]**

1. Split into halves: [38, 27, 43, 3] and [9, 82, 10].
2. Split recursively: [38, 27], [43, 3], [9, 82], [10].
3. Base case: Single elements [38], [27], [43], [3], [9], [82], [10].
4. Merge step-by-step:
   - [38] + [27] → [27, 38]
   - [43] + [3] → [3, 43]
   - [27, 38] + [3, 43] → [3, 27, 38, 43]
   - [9] + [82] → [9, 82]
   - [9, 82] + [10] → [9, 10, 82]
   - [3, 27, 38, 43] + [9, 10, 82] → [3, 9, 10, 27, 38, 43, 82]

### Python Implementation

```python
def merge_sort(arr):
    if len(arr) > 1:
        mid = len(arr) // 2
        left_half = arr[:mid]
        right_half = arr[mid:]
        
        merge_sort(left_half)
        merge_sort(right_half)
        
        i = j = k = 0
        
        while i < len(left_half) and j < len(right_half):
            if left_half[i] < right_half[j]:
                arr[k] = left_half[i]
                i += 1
            else:
                arr[k] = right_half[j]
                j += 1
            k += 1
        
        while i < len(left_half):
            arr[k] = left_half[i]
            i += 1
            k += 1
        
        while j < len(right_half):
            arr[k] = right_half[j]
            j += 1
            k += 1

# Example usage
array = [38, 27, 43, 3, 9, 82, 10]
merge_sort(array)
print("Sorted array:", array)
```

### [PW Sorting Implementations](https://github.com/singhsanket143/Data-Structures-Algorithms-Problem-Solving/tree/master/4.Sorting)

1. Sorting means arranging data in any specific order it could be in increasing or in decreasing order. But, generally people means in increasing order.

2. For different-different use cases there are different-different sorting algorithm that exist. Some of them are:-
   a) Bubble Sort
   b) Selection Sort
   c) Insertion Sort

3. The worst possible sorting algorithm that exist is that when you generate all the possible arrangement/permutation of the data and pick the one which is completely sorted. This approach of sorting will have the time Complexity O(n!). Which is the worst time complexity possible
